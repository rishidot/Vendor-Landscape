# Vendor Landscape

Rishidot Research will publish the landscape of vendors from the point of view of Rishidot's research focus. 

The data in this repo will be continuously updated and we advise you to check back regularly. 
The Github [Watch](https://help.github.com/articles/watching-repositories/) function may be helpful in tracking activity.

If a vendor feels they need to update their information or that they have been left out of the landscape, they should:

* submit an issue with an appropriate subject for discussion, including supporting evidence
* after discussion, the vendor can submit a pull request to perform the update 

We are in the early stages of building a research firm focussed on openness and open data. 
Our strategy is bound to evolve as we grow.
