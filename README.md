# Vendor Landscape

Rishidot Research will publish the landscape of vendors from the point of view of their research focus. The data in this repo will be continuously updated and we advise you to check back regularly. We also strongly encourage vendors to do pull request to update their information or in case they are left out from the landscape. If you are submitting any information through pull request, please provide necessary evidence to support it. We are in the early stages of building a research firm focussed on openness and open data. Our strategy is bound to evolve as we grow.
